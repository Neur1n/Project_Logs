[b library] sicktoolbox
*******************************************************************************
[B CASE] Jugesh was trying to use the sicktoolbox to debug Sick LMS211-S07 LiDAR by
     following an example provided by the guide book.

[R BUG] The compiler couldn't find a header file by

        //codebegin
            #include <sicklms-1.0/SickLMS.hh>
        //codeend

[B CASE] I tried to locate the header file by

        $ locate SickLMS.hh

    No outputs. Then tried

        $ locate sicklms
        $ rospack find sicktoolbox

    The 1st command listed the location of "sicklms" which is an executable
    node file of the package "sicktoolbox_wrapper". The 2nd command showed the
    location of the "sicktoolbox "package. which allowed me to check what is in
    the package. It turned out there is [r NO] decalration (header) or
    implementation files in the pachage directory.

[O NOTE] This verified my assumption that only the node files of "sicktoolbox"
    package were installed into the system. I wanted to locate "sicklms" since
    there is this command provided by the "sicktoolbox_wrapper" tutorial
    ([b http://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms])

        $ rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper [r sicklms] _port:=/dev/XXX _baud:=38400

[B CASE] Downloaded the library from [b http://sicktoolbox.sourceforge.net/] and tried
    to compile to example.

[R BUG] Still couldn't locate the header file.

[B CASE] Tried to compile the "lms_mean_values" example that comes with the
    library using

        $ make

[R BUG] Failed. (I forgot the output of the terminal.)

[B CASE] Check the guide book. On page 6 and 7, it says that the C++ drivers has to
    be built by

        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

[R BUG] 4 errors occurred during "make". Part of the error messages is

        error: there are no arguments to 'usleep' that depend on a template
        parameter, so a declaration of 'usleep' must be available
        [-fpermissive]
            usleep(1000);
                       ^

[O NOTE] Don't fucking complain why this happens. Compiler provides such messages
    for debugging, not complaining. And don't fucking ask me, ask Google, or
    DuckDuckGo as you wish.

[G SOL] I asked DuckDuckGo, and I got this solution
    ([b http://answers.ros.org/question/230106/error-while-installing-sick-lidar-cmatlab-toolbox/])
