[R BUG] When using "[r \includepdf]" at the beginning of a document, it always starts
    with a blank page.

[G SOL] This is because the "pdfpages" package always insert a new page before the
    file that needs to be included. To solve it, delete the "[r \newpage]" on line
    448 of the file "pdfpages.sty" temporarily for this document.
